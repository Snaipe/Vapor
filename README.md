What is Vapor?
-----------------
Vapor is a java library that eases the process of connecting with peers on a p2p network.
It uses bittorrent trackers to find people on the same info hash

How do I use it ?
-----------------

The first thing you want to do is to join a "peer world".
A peer world is some kind of group that peers may join, identified by a unique 20-bytes-long string. Each world exists through the bittorrent trackers that you specify.

```
PeerWorld peerWorld = Join.as("Your nickname")
        .on("The group name")
        .withTrackers("udp://some-tracker.com:73840", "udp://some-other-tracker.com:38884")
        .update();
```

You may call update() at any time to update the peer list (note that update() is blocking).
Once updated, the PeerWorld will hold the peers that have joined the group :

```
Peer[] peers = peerWorld.getPeers();

// do things with your peers
```

And if you don't plan to update the peer list ever again, you'll need to close it :

```
peerWorld.close();

// you can continue to do access your peer list.
```
